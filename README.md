# Speed-Editor-NodeJS
Speed Editor HID implementation in Node JS

This project was tested only on Raspberry PI in Electron build, just for my own needs. But maybe you find it usable for you.
If you want to use this on RPI also, or I think any other linux distribution, you need to alter priveleges, because this is needed for connection.
